I got a good chunk of code added for handlebars and all that to make the site responde to submited data. 
I am not as framiliar with Handlebars as I would like to be. Using the example in the assignment helped some. 
Feel free to edit/delete/whatever. Or if you think a different approach is better, go for it. 

I have been trying to get it up and running withoutour index.html, I changed the filename briefly to give it a shot, 
but I couldn't make it work. I did for the example and host it on my account to see if it loaded, it doesn't just 
the readme loads. Link: https://kurtkaiser.github.io/

Yeah, so feel free to tinker or try something completely different.
